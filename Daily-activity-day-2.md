DB Schema:

A database schema is a logical blueprint or plan that defines the structure and organization of a database. It represents the way data is organized, stored, and related within the database. A schema provides a framework for the database, specifying tables, fields, data types, constraints, and relationships between different elements. It acts as a roadmap for how the data should be structured and accessed by applications or users.
